# 2019 Official Website

My website is developed using Gatsby.js, a powerful static site generator. Of course, that also means it is powered by the React framework.

I've made several modifications here and there to fine tune the original template to suit my needs.

Modified from [Gatstrap's Gatsby Starter Template](https://github.com/jaxx2104/gatsby-starter-bootstrap) and [Kross's Hugo Portfolio Template](https://github.com/themefisher/kross-hugo-portfolio-template) (yes, I've made the language conversion from Hugo to React for this particularly lovely theme!)

## Current Technology Stack

- **Gatsby** for blazing fast static-site generator
- **Netlify** for automatic deployment
- **GraphQL** for database lookup
- **Cloudinary** for image optimization
- **Google Analytics** for tracking views and users

## Usage

develop
`gatsby develop`
